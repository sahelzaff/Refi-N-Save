    </div>
    <div class="testflex">
      <div class="testpara">While Kerren wanted to own an investment property, she had three other loans that were set
        interest only for almost 5 years.<br><br>
        So the first change we made is to help her move to principal + interest loans.

        With financial security and a good mortgage buffer for emergencies, both of her properties became
        self-sufficient.<br><br>With the whole package of refinancing investment and home loans for great interest
        rates, she
        saved $18000 in the first year itself, which translated to massive savings over the years.</div>

      <div class="testpara">Retired and living happily in Darwin, Eddie had acquired a fairly good super fund from
        working in the railways. Willing to secure his retirement with a good investment, Eddie went to AMP bank for
        advice. Somewhere along the line, he realized they had advised him wrongly, and that's when he met borrower
        first. <br><br>

        While things were always abstract at the big bank, Borrower First coached him openly and helped him get the best
        product available then. <br><br>

        Eddie now lives free, in a place now where the weather is good and suits his metabolism, and he is quite happy
        with his financial situation.</div>

    </div>
    <div class="testflex">
      <div class="testpara">When Rob, owner of The Gas Man Company, was looking to consolidate his debt, Borrower First
        figured out a way to help him save about 2.5% on his interest rates, which was a significant amount considering
        their loans. <br><br> The freed-up cash after refinancing their debt was a great relief for him, his wife and
        his business. <br><br>At the end of it all, we helped Rob save almost $40,000 in his loan repayments in the
        first year! Rob said that with this newly gained financial freedom, for the first time in a long time, they were
        looking to book an overseas holiday that they had put off for a long while.
